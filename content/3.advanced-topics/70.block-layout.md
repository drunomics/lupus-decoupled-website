# Block layout with Drupal

As documented at [Site layout & Menus](/guide/site-layout-menus) by default the site header and footer are built by the frontend. That means, the Drupal *Blocks Layout* configuration is ignored for custom-elements rendered pages.

However, with the optional "Lupus Decoupled Blocks" sub-module the configured blocks may be rendered and included with the page response. This may be useful when Drupal should generate the content for a certain region for every page, e.g. a sitebar.

## How does it work

When the module "Lupus Decoupled Blocks" is enabled, all configured blocks are rendered with custom elements for every page. The result is grouped by region and added to the custom-elements page API response under a new top-level `blocks` key. In turn, the frontend just needs to render and place the custom-element content of each region on the page.
