# Debugging API requests

For debugging API requests and responses, Lupus Decoupled Drupal offers
integration with [REST Log](https://www.drupal.org/project/rest_log)
module.

In decoupled scenarios visitors, are making requests to the front-end application,
which is itself retrieving data from the back-end. It is helpful to see the
form of requests that reached the decoupled back-end and the responses that
the back-end provided.

Logged data consists of:
- Request method
- Request header
- Request URI
- Request cookie
- Request payload
- Response status
- Response header
- Response body
- Response time

## Usage

Make some requests either to API endpint (`/admin/content` view provides **View
 API Endpoint operation** for nodes that opens their API endpoint directly) or front-end
requests and investigate them at `/admin/reports/rest_log`.

## Set up

- `composer require --dev drupal/rest_log`
- `drush en lupus_decoupled_api_log`

### Configuration

REST Log module's default configuration is sufficient but it can be changed at
`/admin/config/development/logging/rest_log`.

# Debugging with curl

Sometimes it is useful to trigger [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) from the command
line. This can be achieved with [curl](https://curl.se/). Authorization can be
provided via session cookie with values copied from the authenticated browser
session.

Example of such curl request:
```
curl -k -i -H 'Cookie: SSESS<seesion-name>=<session-cookie-value>;XDEBUG_SESSION=XDEBUG_ECLIPSE;' https://<domain>/<API-endpoint>
```
