# JSON-API & GraphQL

When data needs to be queried or updated from the frontend, Drupal offers plenty of options. Lupus Decoupled Drupal's provided API may be combined with any of those:

## JSON-API

Drupal provides complete RESTful JSON-API module, which is included with Drupal core and works with all Drupal entities (and its access system) out-of-the-box. Following are the most relevant resources to get started:

 * [Documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-modules/jsonapi-module
   )
 * [jsonapi-client npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drupal-api-client/json-api-client)
 * [Json:API Extras module](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi_extras) - Configure which entities are exposed
 * [Simple OAuth](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_oauth) - Authenticate requests via API token

## GraphQL

Alternatively, there are Drupal extension modules that add GraphQL support:

 * [GraphQL module](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql/)
 * [GraphQL compose](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql_compose)
