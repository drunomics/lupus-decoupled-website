# Listings, Views

The [Lupus Decoupled Views](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/lupus_decoupled/-/blob/1.x/modules/lupus_decoupled_views/README.md)
submodule provides support for Drupal's Views module. The Views module is Drupal's native way and very powerful way of creating listings of content. It provides a UI for configuring complex queries, searches and the rendering of results, including paging.

As alternative to Views-based listings, the frontend may [create custom routes](/nuxt/custom-routes) and listings by querying the backend, see [JSON-API, GraphQL](/advanced-topics/jsonapi-graphql).

## Usage

After enabling the sub-module, create a view, skip the wizard and follow the following steps:

1. Add `Custom elements display page` to a view (not a regular page!).
2. Select `Custom elements` style as view format.
3. Select `Content` as row style. Choose the view-mode you want to use for the listed elements.
4. Configure filters and other options as suiting and set a path for the view.
5. The Custom elements API of the view is available at `/ce-api/<view-path>`. Take note of the custom element name visible in the output, which will be `drupal-view-{ID}`.
6. On the frontend clone the `drupal-view--default` component and create a component using the noted custom element name `drupal-view-{ID}`. Test the view on the frontend at the configured path `<view-path>` and customize the component as desired.


Note that the chosen view-mode is automatically rendered with custom elements within the view. It's not required to force rendering it via custom elements.

## Video tutorial

In the following tutorial an example configuration can be followed: [![Video tutorial](/images/lupus-decoupled-youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/live/KKTl4z_MGSg?si=j4qWfVlo9IOiobDy&t=1352)

Note: The tutorial is a year old and uses `drupal-view` as custom element name. That changed meanwhile, use `drupal-view-{ID}` as custom element name or stay with the default `drupal-view--default`.

## Status

* Support for Views is rather new and problems may arise with certain configurations. Please report any issues in the [Lupus Decoupled Drupal issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/lupus_decoupled?categories=All).
* Atm there is no support for rendering exposed filter forms. So those need to be added manually in the frontend, when needed.
* The Row style `Fields` is not supported yet (see
[#3461874](https://www.drupal.org/project/lupus_decoupled/issues/3461874)).
* Items formatted as `Rendered entities` are supported. These are needed for [Search API Index Views](20.searches.md#search-api-views).
