# Multi-frontend

Thanks to the component-oriented decoupling of Lupus Decoupled Drupal, it's really easy to connect a frontend of choice!

## Supported frontend frameworks

Lupus Decoupled provides supports for the following frontend frameworks:


| Framework                                                                                                                       | Technology         | Status                        | Description                                               | Link                                                                               |

## Adding a new frontend framework

Adding a support for a new framework is quite easy. Here is a short overview of what the frontend needs to take care of:

* *Proxying requests*: The frontend typically proxies requests to the Drupal `/ce-api` endpoint, while preserving the request URI and optionally some request headers.
That way, a request to `/news` is served by the frontend, which requests the backend API at `/ce-api/news` and takes care
of rendering the response.
* *Forwarding headers*: By forwarding the cookie header, the frontend may easily leverage Drupal [authentication handling](/guide/authentication).
* *Rendering page content*: The `content` section of a response contains a nested tree of custom elements that need to be rendered on the page.
* *Render a page shell*: Request [navigation menus](/guide/site-layout-menus#navigation-menus) and render them as part of a [site layout](/guide/site-layout-menus).
* *Support page attributes*: Support all page attributes provided by the Drupal [page API](/get-started/how-it-works#custom-elements-page-api), i.e. render [breadcrumbs and messages](/guide/breadcrumbs-messages), support [Metatags and Local tasks](/guide/metatags-local-tasks).
* *Handle errors*: Take care to not add special handling for HTTP 4xx responses, such that Drupal-controlled error pages get rendered as usual. Simply take care of forwarding the status code.
* *Handle redirects*: When the page-API generates a [redirect response](/guide/redirects#redirect-api-responses) instead of a page, take care to issue a suiting redirect response with the given status code instead of rendering a page.

That's it!
