# Key modules

[Lupus Decoupled Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/lupus_decoupled) builds upon the following two key modules:

  * [Custom Elements](https://www.drupal.org/project/custom_elements)
  * [Lupus Custom Elements Renderer](https://www.drupal.org/project/lupus_ce_renderer)

The custom elements module forms the base: It provides the API to render entities into custom elements. Based upon that the Lupus CE renderer module integrates with the Drupal routing system and renders requests of format `custom_elements` using the custom elements module. On top of that, the  [Lupus Decoupled Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/lupus_decoupled) provides the "Lupus Decoupled Custom Elements API sub-module, which makes this API available in a more opinionated way: It adds a handy `/ce-api` path-prefix and optionally handles redirection to the frontend.

## Lupus Decoupled Integration modules

[Lupus Decoupled Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/lupus_decoupled) ships with more sub-modules that integrate modules like Views, or Forms with the stack.

## Further Useful Drupal modules

Besides the main modules, the following Drupal modules are useful:

 * [Rest menu items](https://drupal.org/project/rest_menu_items) provides a way to easily
   fetch Drupal menus. The Nuxt Drupal module comes with built-in support for it.
 * [Trusted redirect](https://www.drupal.org/project/trusted_redirect) allows the frontend
   to link to Drupal while setting a `destination=<frontend_URL>` redirect target.
 * [Services env parameter](https://www.drupal.org/project/services_env_parameter) to
   set cookie domain or CORS configuration via environment variables. This is what the [project template](https://github.com/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project) does.
