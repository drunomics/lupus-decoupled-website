# Supporting more Drupal forms

Lupus Decoupled Drupal supports submitting Drupal forms via the decoupled frontend, as documented under [Advanced Topics - Drupal Forms](/advanced-topics/drupal-forms).
In order to enable submitting another Drupal form on the frontend, a custom-elements enabled form processing route must be added. This is
done easily by:

1. Ensuring there is a custom-elements enabled route, e.g. by cloning the original one and
   adding `custom_elements` as `_format`.
2. Pointing the custom-elements enabled route to a form controller that renders the results as
   custom elements. For standard forms, the following controllers may be specified:
  * For general forms: `lupus_decoupled_form.controller.form:getContentResult`
  * For entity forms:  `lupus_decoupled_form.controller.entity_form:getContentResult`
    
    Else, a custom controller can be easily be provided with the help of the `CustomElementsFormControllerTrait`,
    see the `lupus_decoupled_contact` submodule for an example.

That's it!

Generally, The [Lupus Decoupled Contact](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/lupus_decoupled/-/tree/1.x/modules/lupus_decoupled_contact) module serves as
a simple example that demonstrates how support for contact forms is enabled.
