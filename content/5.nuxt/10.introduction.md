# Intro to Nuxt

 [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) is an open source framework under MIT license that makes web development simple and powerful.

 * Like Drupal, it's extensible using [modules](https://nuxt.com/modules).
 * Thanks to the [Drupal Custom Elements Connector module](https://github.com/drunomics/nuxt-module-drupal-ce) Nuxt simply works with Lupus Decoupled Drupal.
 * Thanks to [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and its template-like [Single File Components](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-components.html) its easy to get started and developers can focus on writing standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript in their Vue components.

## Flexible hosting

With Nuxt you can decide what rendering strategy you want to use, if you like even at the route level: SSR, SSG, CSR. Build any kind of website or web application with optimized performance in mind.

## Outstanding performance

Nuxt comes with many optimizations, e.g. code-splitting, tree-shaking, link prefetching, payload extraction, just to name a few. It's built for serverless usage, has optimized cold-starts and is small enough to be deployed to the edge.

## SEO & Web Vitals

By leveraging server-side rendering, code-splitting and optimized images, Nuxt websites are indexable by search engines while providing an optimized user experience to end-users.

## Rich ecosystem

There are many useful [modules](https://nuxt.com/modules) available that extend Nuxt, like [nuxt-i18n](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/internationalization) and [nuxt-seo](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/seo).

## Great DX

As usual, Nuxt comes with a built-in dev-mode that instantly hot-reloads during development (simply run `npm run dev`). Moreover, the [Nuxt devtools](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/devtools) provide great in-browser dev-tooling and introspection possibilities.
