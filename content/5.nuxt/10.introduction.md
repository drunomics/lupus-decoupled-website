# Nuxt

Build your next [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) application with confidence using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com). An open source framework under MIT license that makes web development simple and powerful.

Like Drupal, it's extensible using modules.
Thanks to Vue.js and the [Drupal Custom Elements Connector](https://github.com/drunomics/nuxt-module-drupal-ce) developers the frontend just works with Lupus Decoupled Drupal and developers can focus on writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript in their Vue components.

## On-demand Rendering

With Nuxt you can decide what rendering strategy you want to use, if you like even at the route level: SSR, SSG, CSR. Build any kind of website or web application with optimized performance in mind.

## Optimized for serverless

Nuxt comes with many optimizations, e.g. code-splitting, tree-shaking, link prefetching, payload extraction, just to name a few. It's built for serverless usage, has optimized cold-starts and is small enough to be deployed to the edge.

## SEO & Web Vitals

By leveraging server-side rendering, code-splitting and optimized images, Nuxt websites are indexable by search engines while providing an optimized user experience to end-users.
