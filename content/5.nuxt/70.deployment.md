# Deployment options

The deployment of Nuxt largely depends on the frontend [rendering mode](/nuxt/rendering-modes) chosen. Please refer to the
Nuxt [deployment guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for additional details.

## Server-rendered

 * **Run a Node.js Server** - Useful for deploying Nuxt apps to any Node.js hosting. [Details](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#nodejs-server)
 * **Edge-Side Rendering** - Run nuxt close to the user, e.g. at edge servers of a CDN. [Details](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#edge-side-rendering)

Nuxt uses Nitro as its server framework. Thus, also refer to the [Nitro deployment documentation](https://nitro.build/deploy) for additional details.
For deployments via Docker, an example Dockerfile can be found [here](https://nitro.build/deploy/providers/koyeb#using-a-docker-container).


## Static hosting

* **Static Site Generation** prerenders the site during build time. [Details](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#static-hosting)
* **Client-side rendering** renders everything the browser. [Details](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#client-side-only-rendering)

For serving static files a general web-server is generally good-enough, additionally there are [deployment presets](https://nuxt.com/deploy) available that make it
easy to trigger the pre-rendering process and serve the resulting build, e.g. with Github or Gitlab pages.

## Supported presets

Nuxt comes with lots of supported presets. Refer to the [Nuxt deployment presets](https://nuxt.com/deploy).
