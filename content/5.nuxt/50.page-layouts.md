# Page layouts

Layouts are placed in the `./layouts` directory and are used to define a shared layout for a group of pages. 

For example, you can have a `default.vue` layout that is used for all pages, and a `blog.vue` layout that is used for all blog posts.

## Create a layout

To create a layout, simply create a `.vue` file in the `./layouts` directory.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Blog layout</h1>
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
```

## Use a layout

To use a layout, you can use the `layout` property in your page:

```vue
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  layout: 'blog',
});
</script>
```
