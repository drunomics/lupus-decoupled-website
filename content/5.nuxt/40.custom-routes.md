# Custom Routes

Custom routes are routes that are not defined in Drupal. They are defined in the frontend and can be used to render custom pages.

## Defining frontend routes

In the frontend, the Drupal routing is managed by the wildcard `pages/[...slug].vue` file within the pages directory.

In order to create a custom route in the frontend:

1. Go to the `pages` directory.
2. Create a new file with the desired route name. For instance, if you want a route named `search`, create a file called `search.vue`.

## Relation to Drupal routes

In your Nuxt.js application, the routing mechanism runs in the following order:

1. **Nuxt.js Routing:** It attempts to align the navigated path with one of the predefined routes located in your `pages` directory.

2. **Dynamic Route Fallback:** If no predefined routes match, the system defaults to a wildcard route. This is represented by the `[...slug].vue` dynamic route, which serves as the fallback.

## Fallback routes

In the event that no matching route is found, by default, error pages provided by Drupal (e.g. 403, 404 page) are shown, while keeping the right status code.
