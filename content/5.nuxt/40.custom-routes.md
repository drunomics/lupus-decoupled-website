# Custom routes

Custom routes are routes that are not defined in Drupal. They are defined in the frontend and can be used to render custom pages.

## Defining frontend routes

In the frontend, the Drupal routing is managed by the wildcard `pages/[...slug].vue` file within the pages directory.

In order to create a custom route in the frontend:

1. Go to the `pages` directory.
2. Create a new file with the desired route name. For instance, if you want a route named `search`, create a file called `search.vue`.

## Relation to Drupal routes

When a user navigates to a route in your Nuxt.js application, Nuxt.js will then communicate with the Drupal backend to see if the route exists there.

## Fallback routes

In the event that no matching route is found, by default, error pages provided by Drupal (e.g. 403, 404 page) are shown, while keeping the right status code.

In order to use regular Nuxt error pages, you can enable the `customErrorPages` option in `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  drupalCe: {
    customErrorPages: true,
    // options...
  }
})
```
