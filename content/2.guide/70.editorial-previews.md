# Editorial previews

## Content previews

When editing a content node, Drupal displays a preview button. The Lupus custom elements renderer module supports rendering preview routes, so previews of content nodes work fine. For improving this preview with a back button, please refer to [this issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/lupus_ce_renderer/issues/3347003).

## Responsive preview

Lupus Decoupled Drupal integrates with the Drupal [responsive preview module](https://www.drupal.org/project/responsive_preview). After installing the extension module, simply enable the provided "Lupus Decoupled Responsive Preview" module.

When the module is setup, the responsive preview widget in the Drupal admin toolbar may be used on the content node edit form to open the preview in a modal dialog.
