# Pages & Routing

By default, all page requests are forwarded to Drupal. Thus Drupal paths handling, routing, path-alias handling as well as 404 or 403 page handling all work out of the box.

## Configure error page and ftontpage

The default pages (front, 403, and 404) are configured in the Drupal admin UI under:

**Administration** > **Configuration** > **System** > **Site information**

## URL Aliases

URL aliases are configured in the Drupal admin UI and just work. Configure them at:

**Administration** > **Configuration** > **Search and metadata** > **URL aliases**

## Custom routes in the frontend

The frontend can also handle custom routes. For example, you can create a custom route for a page that is not managed by Drupal.

For more information, please see the [Custom routes](/nuxt/custom-routes) section.
