# Pages & Routing

By default, the frontend forwards all page requests to Drupal. Given that, Drupal's routes, URL aliases as well as 404 or 403 pages all work out of the box. However, the frontend may add custom routes in front of Drupal's routing, see "Custom routes in the frontend".

## Configure error page and frontpage

The default pages (front, 403, and 404) are configured in the Drupal admin UI under:

**Administration** > **Configuration** > **System** > **Site information**

## URL Aliases

URL aliases are configured in the Drupal admin UI and just work. Configure them at:

**Administration** > **Configuration** > **Search and metadata** > **URL aliases**

## Custom routes in the frontend

The frontend can also define custom routes. When the frontend defines a custom route, it takes priority and works as usual. When no custom route is defined, the frontend default route forwards requests to Drupal and Drupal's routing takes effect.

For more information on defining custom routes with nuxt, please see the [Custom routes](/nuxt/custom-routes) section.
