## Metatags

Lupus Decoupled Drupal integrates with the Drupal Metatags module and provides the metatags of a page as part of the API response. On the frontend side, that metatags can be picked up easily. The Nuxt CE connector has that functionality built-in, such that metatags and link relations work out of the box.
