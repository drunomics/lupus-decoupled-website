# Redirects

Lupus Decoupled Drupal supports CMS-controlled redirects, i.e. Drupal's page API explicitly informs the frontend
about redirects to be generated. The frontend, in turn, simply generates the right redirect responses. That way,
Drupal-managed redirects just work in the decoupled frontend.

## Redirect API responses

The Drupal [page API](/get-started/how-it-works#custom-elements-page-api) may return data about the page to render OR alternatively
a redirect response. A redirect response is formatted like this:

```json [/some-redirected-path]
{
      "redirect": {
            "external": false,
            "url": "/new-path",
            "statusCode": 301
      },
      "messages": [ ]
}
```

In the above example, the frontend would return a HTTP 301 redirect to `/new-path` when the path `/some-redirect-path`
is requested.

## Managing redirects via UI

The Drupal [Redirect module](https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect) provides the ability to create manual redirects and maintains a canonical URL for all content, redirecting all other requests to that path. To use the module with Lupus Decoupled Drupal, simply install and use it - it just works.

## Creating redirects via code

Drupal modules may programmatically create redirect responses. To do so, simply return a regular redirect response
object from the route, the Lupus CE Renderer module is taking care of converting it to a redirect JSON
response when the custom-elements format is requested automatically.
