# Breadcrumbs & Messages

## Breadcrumbs

The Lupus custom elements renderer module integrates with Drupal's breadcrumb handling and simply provides the breadcrumbs generated by Drupal as part of its API response.
Combined with the default components provided by the Nuxt Drupal CE Connector module, the breadcrumbs are output as generated by default.

Drupal breadcrumbs may be customized using Drupal's API or by installing some contributed
module that provide UI for doing so, for example [Easy breadcrumb](https://www.drupal.org/project/easy_breadcrumb).


## Messages

The Lupus custom elements renderer module integrates with Drupal's message handling
and simply provides Drupal messages as part of its API response. Combined with the
default components provided by the Nuxt Drupal CE Connector modules, Drupal messages are displayed automatically.

### Messages with static site generation

When a redirect points to a statically pre-generated page, there is no API request made for the static page. For a message to be displayed, the message must be sent with the redirect response (unlike with the next page response, which is the Drupal default).

### Messages with server renderings

For server-rendering, messages need to be sent with the subsequent page response. If sent with the redirect response, a message is only displayed when the redirect response is handled by a client-side API request. To fix this for server-rendered redirect responses please see [this issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/lupus_ce_renderer/issues/3467399).
