# Layout builder

The Drupal [layout builder](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/layout-builder) module may be leveraged for customizing the page layout per entity or content type within Drupal. Optionally, this default may be customized by each individual content item. That way, the module can be used as a custom page builder tool.

## Rendering layouts

By default, layouts are rendered using a `<drupal-layout>` custom element for each layout section, such that any section settings are forwarded to the frontend. Contained blocks may build their content using custom elements, or fallback to Drupal rendering and regular HTML.

Please see [Drupal > Providing blocks](/drupal/providing-blocks) for more details on how to provide Drupal blocks that render custom elements.

## Layout previews

Lupus Decoupled Drupal provides a route for previewing layouts in the frontend, i.e. `node/XX/layout-preview`. For providing a nice UX to open the preview, the integration with the responsive preview module is leveraged (see [editorial previews](/guide/editorial-previews)). The responsive preview widget in the Drupal admin toolbar may be used on the layout builder page to open the preview in a modal dialog. Additionally, a link to open a full-page preview in a new tab is provided.
