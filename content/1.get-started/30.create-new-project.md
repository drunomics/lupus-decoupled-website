# Create a new project

## Local setup with ddev

For setting up a new project, you may want to use the [lupus-decoupled-project](https://github.com/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project/) template, which supports both [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io)
cloud environments and local docker-based development environments via [https://ddev.readthedocs.io].

### Prerequisites: ddev & docker

ddev is a ridiculously simple setup for complex development environments, based upon docker compose.

Requirements:
* ddev v1.21.4 or later. Please follow the [installation instructions](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install/ddev-installation/)

### Launch it

To spin up the project locally run:

      ddev start
      ddev composer install
      ddev drush site-install -y --account-pass=admin --site-name='lupus_decoupled' standard
      ddev drush pm-enable lupus_decoupled -y
      # Configure lupus-decoupled frontend base URL
      ddev drush config:set lupus_decoupled_ce_api.settings frontend_base_url https://lupus-nuxt.ddev.site -y
      # Login and get started adding some test-nodes
      ddev drush user-login

When using ddev locally, the URLs are by default:

  * Frontend: https://lupus-nuxt.ddev.site
  * Backend: https://lupus-decoupled.ddev.site


Once you are up and running, try adding some content nodes and menu items to see it working and continue with your [first steps](/get-started/first-steps)


### ddev configuration

#### URLs

If you want to customize URLs, take a look at the [.ddev/config.yaml](https://github.com/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project/blob/main/.ddev/config.yaml) file and re-run `ddev start`.

#### Frontend repository

By default, the [nuxt3-demo](https://github.com/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-nuxt3-demo) frontend repository is used. It can be customized by setting the `FRONTEND_REPOSITORY` via ddev config:

      # Configure a different frontend repository.
      ddev config --web-environment-add="FRONTEND_REPOSITORY=https://github.com/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-nuxt3-demo"


### Resources

* [.ddev/config.yaml](https://github.com/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project/blob/main/.ddev/config.yaml) - main ddev (default) configuration, can be generated by running `ddev config`
* [ddev docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io)


## Custom setup

If preferred, you can incorporate the pieces in your custom setup and/or setup everything from scratch by following the next steps.

### Setting up Drupal

If you don't have an existing Drupal installation yet, or you want to start from scratch,
install Drupal first:

```bash
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project drupal-project
cd drupal-project
```

If you do not have composer installed, see the official [composer installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

Continue with the Drupal installation, e.g. by using Drupal's quick start command:
```bash
php ./web/core/scripts/drupal quick-start standard
```

The quick-start command uses PHP's built-in webserver to run your site. Just keep it running after installation.

If you prefer a full local development setup based upon docker, check the
[Local development guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/official_docs/en/_local_development_guide.html).

Add [drush](https://drush.org) - the Drupal cli:

```
composer require drush/drush
# If no global drush launcher is already in use, run
alias drush=$PWD/vendor/bin/drush
```

### Adding Lupus Decoupled Drupal

The [Lupus Custom Elements renderer module](https://www.drupal.org/project/lupus_ce_renderer) lets Drupal provide
an API backend rendering custom elements. Add the module and its dependencies, then enable the module
via the UI or if installed, via [drush](https://drush.org).

```bash
composer config minimum-stability beta
composer require drupal/lupus_decoupled:@beta
drush en lupus_decoupled -y
drush user-login
```

Test your installation by opening `http://127.0.0.1:8888/ce-api/` - when logged in,
you should see a JSON response with the following `content` property:

```html
<drupal-markup>Welcome to your custom-elements enabled Drupal site!</drupal-markup>
```

### Setting up Nuxt.js


::code-group
  ```bash [npx]
  npx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
  ```
::

Answer the questions as preferred, generally the defaults work fine.
Once the project is created, you can remove the example components.

For further details, please refer to the [official Nuxt installation docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation).


### Adding the Nuxt connector module

Please refer to the [Setup steps](/nuxt/drupal-ce-connector) then continue below.

### Run nuxt

Ready to go! Start testing by running Nuxt in development mode:

::code-group
  ```bash [npm]
  npm run dev
  ```
  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn dev
  ```
  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm dev
  ```
::

Now, when accessing the nuxt dev server (e.g. at http://localhost:3000/)
you should see a naked page rendered, having the "Home" breadcrumb
and the message shown to logged-out users on the frontpage:
"You are not authorized to access this page."

### Connecting the dots

In your Drupal backend, set the URL of your frontend site, either via UI or via console:


      drush config:set lupus_decoupled_ce_api.settings frontend_base_url http://localhost:3000 -y
