## About Gitpod.io

Gitpod is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to work on their code projects collaboratively and efficiently. The online demo is built using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) and its Drupal integration, [DrupalPod](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/drupalpod/getting-started)


Gitpod provides 50 hours per month for *free*, so you can just log in via GitHub and give it a try!
