## About Gitpod

Gitpod is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to work on their code projects collaboratively and efficiently. The online demo is built using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) and its Drupal integration, [DrupalPod](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/drupalpod/getting-started)


Gitpod provides 50 hours per month for free, so you can just log in via GitHub and give it a try!

- [Lupus Decoupled Drupal - 1.x-dev with Drupal 11 & Nuxt3 on Gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/new/#DP_PROJECT_NAME=lupus_decoupled,DP_ISSUE_BRANCH=1.x,DP_PROJECT_TYPE=project_module,DP_MODULE_VERSION=1.x,DP_CORE_VERSION=10.3,DP_PATCH_FILE=,FRONTEND_REPOSITORY=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdrunomics%2Flupus-decoupled-nuxt3-demo,CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_VERSION=3.*,DP_INSTALL_PROFILE=standard/https://github.com/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project/tree/main)
