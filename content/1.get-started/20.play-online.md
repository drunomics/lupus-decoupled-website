## About GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a cloud-based development environment integrated with
GitHub, allowing you to develop directly within your browser. Github Codespaces
provides 120 hours and 15 GB/month storage for *free*! This allows you to explore
 **Lupus Decoupled Drupal** without a local setup.

## Quick Start with Preconfigured Codespaces

Choose one of the following preconfigured development environments based on
your needs (clicking on a link launches that Codespace):
- [Drupal 11 + Nuxt Naked Starter](https://codespaces.new/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project?quickstart=1){target="_blank"}
- [Drupal 11 + Nuxt with shadcn/ui components](https://codespaces.new/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fnuxt-shadcn%2Fdevcontainer.json){target="_blank"}
- [Drupal 11 + Next.js frontend](https://codespaces.new/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fnextjs%2Fdevcontainer.json){target="_blank"}

## How to Use It?
1. Click on the link for your desired configuration.
2. GitHub will automatically create a new Codespace with the selected setup.
3. Wait for the container to initialize—this may take a few minutes.
4. Once ready, the development environment is fully set up and running in your browser.
5. In the `ports` tab there are links to the running services.
   - Frontend is available by clicking the link next to port 3000.
   - Backend is at port 80. By default it redirects to frontend. To prevent redirect visit the /user/login path of backend URL.

The environment may take a few minutes to initialize. Once you are up and running, try adding some content nodes and
menu items to see it working . Then continue with your [first steps](/get-started/first-steps)


## What’s Included in the Setup?
- A fully configured development container, with both Drupal and a frontend.
- Automatic port forwarding for running services.
- Development setup based upon ddev.
