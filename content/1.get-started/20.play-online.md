## About GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a cloud-based development environment integrated with
GitHub, allowing you to develop directly within your browser. It offers a free
tier with a set number of usage hours per month, enabling you to explore
projects like **Lupus Decoupled Drupal** without local setup.

Github Codespaces provides 120 hours and 15 GB/month storage for *free*, so you
can just log into GitHub and give it a try!

## Quick Start with Preconfigured Codespaces

your needs (clicking on a link launches that Codespace):
