# Deployment Strategies

Lupus Decoupled Drupal can be deployed in two main ways: a unified deployment using a single hosting environment for both Drupal and frontend, or a separated deployment using distinct environments for each.

## Separated Deployment

In a separated deployment strategy, the frontend and Drupal backend are deployed independently. This approach offers several advantages:

- Faster frontend deployments without dependency on Drupal maintenance windows
- Freedom to choose specialized frontend hosting solutions (e.g., serverless edge deployments or vendors offering simplified pre-rendering)
- Independent scaling and optimization of each component

However, this approach has some trade-offs:
- Additional complexity in coordinating multiple hosting environments
- More involved management of deployments, especially for features requiring both frontend and backend changes
- Increased operational overhead for maintaining multiple environments

For applying a separated deployment, please refer to the documentation of each separate system. For Nuxt frontends, some
additional deployment documentation is provided [here](/nuxt/deployment).

## Unified Deployment

The unified deployment strategy offers a simpler approach by maintaining a single deployment process for the entire application. This strategy:

- Requires a hosting environment capable of running both frontend (e.g., Node.js) and Drupal backend services
- Simplifies deployment coordination and environment management
- Enables direct communication between frontend and backend services (e.g., cache or search servers)

This approach is well-suited for teams preferring the operational simplicity or simple projects. A list of
unified hosting possibilities can be found [here](/deployment/unified-hosting).


## Frontend rendering modes

Modern frontend frameworks support multiple rendering modes which may be combined with both deployment strategies. By default, Lupus
Decoupled Drupal uses a Nuxt frontend with server-rendering. Refer to the [Nuxt rendering modes](/nuxt/rendering-modes)
or the documentation for your frontend framework for details.
