# Unified hosting options

The following (in-complete) list of hosting providers offer specialized Drupal hosting while being able to host a decoupled
frontend.

## Amazee.io

Amazee.io provides a managed open source hosting platform based on Kubernetes. It offers [Drupal hosting](https://www.amazee.io/drupal) and Node.js
support. It provides the flexibility to add backend and frontend in one project, or as separate projects.

## Pantheon.io

Pantheon.io offers [Drupal hosting](https://pantheon.io/product/drupal-hosting) and optionally a decoupled [frontend site](https://pantheon.io/features/decoupled-cms)
as well. Still, the frontend is deployed separately from the backend, so each sytem can be deployed on its own.

## upsun

upsun (by platform.sh) is a cloud application platform. It offers [Drupal support](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/drupal-and-upsun/) as well as [Node.js support](https://docs.upsun.com/get-started/here/configure/nodejs.html). Depending on the
configuration, frontend and backend can be deployed as a single app, or as two separate apps.
